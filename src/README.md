Meal Factory Lab
---------------------
In the factory.abstractfactory.meals package, create another MealFactory that produces different Meals of the following types:

- "breakfast"
- "lunch"
- "dinner"

Demonstrate that your new MealFactory can be substituted for the GermanMealFactory by changing only the first line in MealDriver's main() method.

Calculator Singleton Lab
---------------------
Create two new classes in the singleton.calculator package:

- ThreadSafeCalcTool.java: a Singleton that is thread-safe
- EnumCalcTool.java: a Singleton that is an enum

Modify the CalculatorDriver class to use both new singleton classes. Using each singleton, calculate the four BMIs and print the average.
Both singletons should produce the same output.
